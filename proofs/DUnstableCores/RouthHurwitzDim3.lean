# Exact cubic Routh--Hurwitz boundary theorem

For a monic cubic `X^3 + a₁ X^2 + a₂ X + a₃`, coefficientwise
nonnegativity together with `a₁*a₂-a₃ ≥ 0` excludes every eigenvalue in the
open right half-plane.  Weak inequalities are intentional: imaginary-axis
and zero roots belong to `HurwitzNonpositive`, not strict Hurwitz stability.
